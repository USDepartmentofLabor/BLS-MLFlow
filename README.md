This repository houses the documentation and example code for 2022 Civic Digital Fellow Remy Stewartâ€™s summer project piloting the use of the open-source MLOps platform MLflow for BLS data science workflows. 
- The docs folder hosts the bls_mlflow_docs Markdown file that provides an overview of the MLflow pilot intergration project. 
- The examples folder features six Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how MLflow can be incorporated into machine learning scripts each drawing from public data.
- The mlprojects folder overviews how to design MLflow Projects as runnable directories and deploy logged models as local REST APIs. 

Information internal to BLS has been removed throughout this repository in preparation for public Github posting. My personal Github is https://github.com/remypstewart if you're open to linking me directly as a collaborator on the repository as well!
